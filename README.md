# OmniData Connector

## Overview

OmniData Connector is a data source connector developed for openLooKeng. 

The OmniData connector allows querying data sources where OmniData Server is deployed. It pushes down some operators such as filter to the OmniData service close to the storage to improve the performance of storage-computing-separated system.

## Building OmniData Connector

1. OmniData Connector is developed under the architecture of openLooKeng. You need to build openLooKeng first as a non-root user.
2. Simply run the following command from the project root directory:<br>
`mvn clean install -Dos.detected.arch="aarch64"`<br>
Then you will find omnidata-openlookeng-connector-*.zip in the omnidata-openlookeng-connector/connector/target/ directory.
OmniData Connector has a comprehensive set of unit tests that can take several minutes to run. You can disable the tests during building:<br>
`mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dos.detected.arch="aarch64"`<br>

## Deploying OmniData Connector

1. Unzip omnidata-openlookeng-connector-*.zip to the plugin directory of openLooKeng.
2. Obtain the latest OmniData software package, and replace the boostkit-omnidata-server-\*.jar in the omnidata-openlookeng-connector-\* directory.
3. Set "connector.name=omnidata-openlookeng" in the openLooKeng catalog properties file.
